# MuninDB

Executing this project has a dependency on having the nodejs runtime installed.
This repo has three node modules:

```
munin-cli -- the command line interface for interacting with a local instance of the database.
munin-lib -- the lib with the core functions of the database implemented. can be imported as a module and used directly.
munin-ws -- the web service with a RESTful interface for interacting with an instance of the database that is hosted by a web server. backed by expressjs.
```

Please visit each repository's readme file for more information on how to execute each of them.
